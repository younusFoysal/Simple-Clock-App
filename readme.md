Scenario: Consider you have been asked to develop a generic library catalog in Java that can store and manage different types of library items.  

You are tasked with utilizing generic classes and methods to ensure flexibility and code reusability. 

Requirements: 


Generic Catalog Class: 
a. Implement a generic catalog class that can store information about library items (e.g., books, DVDs, magazines). 

b. Ensure that the catalog works seamlessly with different types of items by using generics. 


Library Item Class: 
a. Create a generic LibraryItem class with attributes such as title, author, and itemID 

b. Ensure that the LibraryItem class is compatible with the generic catalog. 


Library Operations: 
a. Develop methods within the generic catalog to add a new library item, remove an item, and retrieve item details. 

b. Implement error handling to manage scenarios such as attempting to remove a non-existent item. 


User Interface: 
a. Create a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the library catalog. 

b. Allow users to add a new library item, remove an item, and view the current catalog. 


Testing: 
a. Implement comprehensive testing for your generic catalog and LibraryItem class. 

b. Test scenarios should include adding and removing items, ensuring the catalog works with various types of library items. 




Guidelines
